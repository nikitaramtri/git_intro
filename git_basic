let X be the commit id of a particular state. To restore to that state use
git checkout X
to add the changes between the state (with commit id X) and it's previous state to the current branch
git cherry-pick X 
git log X will show the log upto state (with commit id X)
# : represents hash val
commit id Cn= #(delta(Sn-1,n) + Cn-1 + Mn)
where delta(Sn-1,n) represents changes (additions and deletions) between (n-1)th and nth commit
Cn-1 is the (n-1)th commit id
Mn represents the meta data i.e. author, date and time of commit
